--Creating VMs in cloud--

  creatin needs API which needs to validate,autuntecate,authorize to create

  can be created using AWS GUI   
  AWS CLI
  AWS API
  AWS CFT vs AWS CDK

Accessing VM 
  -AWS console (not convient, session also expires fast)
  -desktop app CLI terminal ( Mac: iterm, windows: mobaXterm)
using command line and Publi IP address to connect to instance , download private key from aws user portal
  $ ssh user@IPaddress (this will denal the connecction)
  $ ssh -i /user/path/downloads/authkey.pem user@IPaddress (faile to connect need to change permissions of the private key to use : changin chmod of key file with 600)
  
to delete the instance in portal
- stop the instance
- terminate the instance

--configuring AWS CLI--

Day6- Linuz and shell scripting (nothing in the video need to search below in chatGpt)
shell commands popiular need to automate and health checks and use cases search
top 
df -h
chmod
free
nproc
ps -ef
grep
vim,vi are interactive
touch - is non interactive
shell script starts with various shells depends on what you want to use
#!/bin/bash
       /ksh
       /sh
       /dash
       /aix
possible interview question shell types

in shell scripting if you having multiple commands executed and out is mess use
