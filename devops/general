--Creating VMs in cloud--

  creatin needs API which needs to validate,autuntecate,authorize to create

  can be created using AWS GUI   
  AWS CLI 
  AWS API-- one application is Boto3 [using boto3 can connect to Azure using its API)
  AWS CFT vs AWS CDK

Accessing VM 
  -AWS console (not convient, session also expires fast)
  -desktop app CLI terminal ( Mac: iterm, windows: mobaXterm)
using command line and Publi IP address to connect to instance , download private key from aws user portal
  $ ssh user@IPaddress (this will denal the connecction)
  $ ssh -i /user/path/downloads/authkey.pem user@IPaddress (faile to connect need to change permissions of the private key to use : changin chmod of key file with 600)
  
to delete the instance in portal
- stop the instance
- terminate the instance

--configuring AWS CLI--
AWS CLI - works with vaious services operating in AWS and flexible to run commands
to download AWS cli , download it from AWS website (linux, windows, max installers)
to show aws cli is installed or not type $aws which  output:/usr/local/bin/aws
AWS CLI needs to authenticate access keys with credentials to connect to user (aws protal /user options/security credentials/ click on create access key key value pair )
note: secreate key should be stored in secure vault or somewhere secure
to configure user with AWS CLI
-$aws configure
-Aws access key ID : enter here
-Aws secrete  access key : enter here
-reagion leave default
-outformat leave json default
-connected

Aws CLI commands
-to list S3 buckets : $aws s3 ls
all templates are available in website


Day6- Linuz and shell scripting (nothing in the video need to search below in chatGpt)
shell commands popiular need to automate and health checks and use cases search
top 
df -h
chmod
free
nproc
ps -ef
grep
awk
cURL
wget
find
trap
kill
wc
jq [jq is json parser]
vim,vi are interactive
touch - is non interactive
shell script starts with various shells depends on what you want to use
#!/bin/bash
       /ksh
       /sh
       /dash
       /aix
possible interview question shell types

permissions and groups 
777 user,group,others
4 write
2 read
1 execute

in shell scripting if you having multiple commands executed and out is mess use 
set -x   #debuug mod
set -e   #exit the script if error  
set -o   #pipefail 
set -e and set -o both needs to be used together because set -e ignores pipe failures so for pipe failures need to add set -e

stdin and stdout 
date command is sending out put to stdin so | doesnt work
ps -ef | grep string | awk -F" " '{print $2}' 
above prints the 2nd coloum from the sp-ef with string match from that line

fetch logs,packages,post values to url
curl -X GET websiteaddress [to get values]
curl -o [incrementall download doesn't puts burden on memory while downloding]

wget downloads the file , also has incremental download
wget url

substuite user super user
sudo su -  
switch user to user
su user

loops ifelse, forloops
check about trap signals 
crontabs

Interview questions
-list the commmon commands
-write a shell script to list all files or process ID in processlist
-crontab
-vim read only mode
-softlink and hardlink
-break and continue commands
-disadvantages of shell scripting
-diffrent types of loops and uses
-dynamically typed and statically typed
-network debuging shell commands (traceroute)
-how to sort names (linux has native command called sort)
- how will you manage logs of a system that generate huge logs files everyday (logrotate)


Shell script
x=missossopi
grep -o "s" < <<"$x" | wc -l
this will optput letter count in a word
   -o only
   "s" just s alphabet
   $x assigned value


Aws ClI commands can be sued in shell scripting - docs available in aws website
aws s3 ls                  [lists s3 buckets]
aws ec2 describe-instances [list Ec2 instances]
aws lambda list-functions  [list lambda]
aws iam list-users         [list IAM users]

aws ec2 describe-instances [this will out put the details in Json formate] to parse the Json below we are using jq
each object has Reservations[], Instances[] arrays

$aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId'
this will output the instances IDs

$aws s3 ls >> resourceTracker [resourceTracker this will output details in to file]

Day8 - https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/shell-scripting-projects/blob/main/github-api/list-users.sh
shell script project Github ApI Integration

Day9-day11 Git and Git hub 

day12 -creating Ec2 instance - creating NSG to open port - deployinh node app

Day13 - AWS services Top 15
Ec2, VPC, EBS, S3, IAM, cloudwatch,LAMBDA,cloud build services [aws code pipeline,code build, code deploy],aws confiration,billing and costing ,Aws KMS, cloud Trail,EKS, fargate , ECS,ELK)     
good to have
ML- Tenserflow

Day14 - Configuration managment
