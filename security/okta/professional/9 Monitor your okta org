Use the Admin Console to Monitor Events

Monitor your Okta environment's health and performance through the administrator dashboard, where you can track user activity, check system status, manage tasks, and generate detailed reports. The dashboard helps you identify potential issues, maintain security, and access troubleshooting information to keep your authentication system running smoothly.

Just as your car's dashboard shows vital signs like engine health and fuel levels, the Okta Administrator Dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into your organization's health. It displays user counts, group statistics, and system status indicators, helping administrators spot potential issues before they become problems

Like having an attentive passenger who notices unusual activity in and around your car, Okta HealthInsight acts as a vigilant observer of your system. It monitors configurations, provides security recommendations, and alerts you to suspicious activities reported by users, ensuring your authentication system stays secure and optimized.

Similar to monitoring your car's fuel consumption and usage patterns to optimize its performance, Okta's Rate Limit Monitoring helps you track and manage your organization's resource usage. It watches your API request patterns, helps prevent service disruptions, and provides detailed logs of system activity - much like reviewing your vehicle's travel history to make better decisions about its use.
