--Secure with Assurance--

Assurance is an advanced authentication approach combining multiple factors to verify user identity.

Authenticators and their characteristics are utilized to achieve assurance levels.

Admins configure authentication requirements and users select the authenticator that meets the specified assurance level.

key charecteristics of assurance
-admin configuration and user decision
-assurance acts as filter
-remediation by design

assurance is achivr by one or more authenticators using wich user use to auth
authernticatoru types
  biometrcs
  possession
  knowledge

email -possion
okta verify - combinations
    possion , possion+knowledge, possession_biometric
passwod- knowledge
phone -possion
security question -knowledge

check authentiators characteristics

assurance levels
  low- password,security question,any single-factor auth method
  medium - MFA with 2 factor categories
  high- MFA with phishing resistant [passwd+webauth-enabled biometric/security key,okta verify OTP+ webauth]

controlling assurance with sign-on policies
multi-layered security
  -rate limiting,threatInsihgt,network zone block listing
  -global session policy [signf-on]
  -authN policy [sign-on]

sign-on policies
  -global session
  define assurance that needs to be satisfied
  -authN policy
  determins which authE end users will be challenged

Okta requires assurance levels to be satisfied before granting end-user access to an application. These assurance levels can be specified 
-Authentication Policies
-Global Session Policies

Okta Policy Framework Explained
okta policies should have 
    common framework
    message structure
    API
    policy settings
    rule data

Assurance is degree of confidence achived using authenticators
about policies and policy rules
policies
  -contain groups of resources that require similar treatmment
  -enable admins to securely control access to applications and APIs
  - contains conditions and actions
  - contains one or more rules minimum  is one

how are policies and rules evaluated
global session policy
authE policy
enrollement policy
password policy

order of execution is top down
authE policies are tied to specific app and evaluatedd when a user attempts to access them, bases on rule priority
