----------Explore Okta Single Sign-On----------

Okta Single Sign-On (SSO) provides a simplified sign-on experience
that increases productivity and security. With SSO, users can access
multiple apps through a single Okta session.

When a user signs in to Okta, Okta authenticates the user
using one set of credentials. After successful authentication,
the user can access multiple apps without having to re-enter their
credentials.

Identity federation
-Identity federation allows a user's identity information to be 
used across multiple systems and domains by establishing a trust
relationship. Identity federation allows a user to authenticate in 
one system or domain and access resources in another system or domain
without having to reauthenticate.
-With identity federation, Okta must establish a trust relationship
between an app and Okta. When a user signs in to Okta using their
credentials, they can access the app without needing to reauthenticate.
-Okta supports these SSO methods for identity federation. Select each
card to learn more.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
-Authentication protocol that uses XML to pass identity data between 
an identity provider and  a service provider
OpenID Connect (OIDC)
-Authentication protocol that uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) to pass 
identity data between an identity provider and a service provider
Web Services Federation (WS-Fed)
-XML-based protocol used to sign in to legacy Windows-based web
apps and Microsoft Office 365

What if my app doesn't support federated SSO?
Some apps don't support federated SSO. Instead, they rely on basic
authentication with a username and password. For these apps, Okta
offers a proprietary SSO method called Secure Web Authentication (SWA).

When using SWA, Okta securely stores the user's app credentials
in your Okta tenant. When the user accesses a SWA app, a browser 
plugin performs a secure form fill to post the user's credentials
to the app.

Okta Integration Network
The Okta Integration Network (OIN) is a catalog of prebuilt app 
integrations provided by Okta. The OIN lets you securely implement
SSO for an app without building and maintaining the integration 
yourself.

To integrate an app using the OIN, go to Applications > Applications from the Admin Console.
Then select Browse App Catalog.
