----set up MFA enrollment---------


MFA enrollment policies
-specify available auhenticators during enrollment
-establish enrollemnt requirments

steps for setting up authenticators
-enable the authenticator
-configure the authenticator
-configure custom enrollemt policies as needed

MFA Enrollment Policies control the enrollment process for authenticators, ensuring users set up the appropriate factors while meeting organizational requirements.
Authenticators can be used for both authentication and self-service recovery, such as account unlocking or password resets.
Users can manage their authenticators and settings, including adding new devices or setting up additional authenticators, through their account settings.

If no authenticator enrollment policy is configured, the default policy enforces enrollment during Okta sign-on.

What authentication policies do for you
Risk-based authentication. 
"Security requirements match application sensitivity."
Advanced protection where needed.
"Critical systems require phishing-resistant keys."
Context-aware decisions. 
"Device health and network location influence access."
Streamlined productivity.
"Everyday tools have appropriate, simpler requirements."

Working with the team, Jordan mapped out every application across FinTech Global, categorizing them by sensitivity, user groups, and required protection level. Then they analyzed the contexts in which these applications were accessed—corporate offices, outside networks, managed devices, and personal phones.

Think of global session policies as the security at the building entrance, while authentication policies are the specific access controls for each room inside.

User context: "Trading team members need different access than marketing." User type (employee, contractor) Group membership Specific user attributes
Device context:  "Financial apps require managed, encrypted devices." Device management state Platform (iOS, Windows) Security posture checks
Network context: "Access from the trading floor versus from home requires different security." IP address or range Network zone membership Geographic location
Authentication requirements: "Sensitive data needs phishing-resistant hardware keys."Factor types requiredPhishing resistance Re-authentication frequency


The implementation strategy
Jordan's team designed a structured approach to authentication policies:
 Application classification: They categorized all applications by sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and user base.
 User groups mapping: They defined which groups needed access to which applications.
 Context definition: They established what context factors matter for each application type.
 Policy creation: They built authentication policies with granular rules based on all these factors.
