--Differentiate the Types of Users in Okta---
Okta's three distinct user types empower organizations to seamlessly integrate and authenticate users across multiple repositories, ensuring efficient user
management and secure access control across their entire digital ecosystem.

Types of users: 
- okta-sourced
  users maintined inside okta, attibutes are modified within okata identity cloud
  authenticated against okta
  credentials are stored in okta
- directory sourced
  brought into okta throgh directory integration ex: MS AD , LDAP
  users maintained inside AD, LDAP
  Attributes modification is done in drectory service
  authenticated against directory provided deligated auth is enabled by default when you install agents
- App sourced 
  source of truth is application (not just HR any other source also)
  attributes are maintined inside of application
  uses cannot be authenticated directly against application, users are brought into okta anauthenticated there or in AD or LDAP
