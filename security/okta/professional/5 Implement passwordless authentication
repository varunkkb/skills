--Enable FastPass with Okta Verify-----
Okta FastPass delivers seamless passwordless authentication on
supported devices and platforms, letting users access their applications 
without entering passwords. Through a one-time setup with Okta Verify,
users gain secure, frictionless access to all their SAML, OIDC, and
WS-Fed apps from any location or network.

Okta Verify is a mobile authenticator app that provides secure MFA for
your Okta account. It offers multiple authentication methods
including push notifications, time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs),
and biometric verification.

FastPass is Okta Verify's passwordless authentication feature that
transforms your device into a security key. When enabled, FastPass
creates a strong user and device binding, establishing a secure 
passwordless connection. Once configured on a supported device
(Windows, Android, macOS, or iOS), users can access their SAML,
OIDC, or WS-FED applications without passwords. FastPass uses a 
combination of device signals and biometric verification to securely 
authenticate you, providing a seamless yet secure authentication 
experience.

Set up
Now that you understand what Okta Verify and FastPass are, let's get started with the setup process.

Install Okta Verify
The first step is installing Okta Verify on your mobile device.

Enable FastPass
With Okta Verify installed on your device, we can now enable FastPass.
This is done through the Okta Verify Enrollment policy in your Okta 
admin console. Let's watch how to configure these settings.

authentication : TOTP, push notification. Okta FastPass
Self-service recovery ( push notification only)

okta verify config option
-signin page option check box : show the "Sign in with Okta Fastpass"

user verification : preferred(default), required
  preferred : biometrics prompted but not enforced
  required: biometrics prompted and enforced

Configure FastPass authentication settings
After enabling FastPass in the Okta Verify Enrollment policy, 
you'll need to configure when and how FastPass can be used.
This is managed through your Authentication Policies and Global 
Session Policy.

In the Authentication Policy, you can specify FastPass as an 
authentication factor and set conditions for its use. 
Common configurations include:

-Setting FastPass as the primary authentication method.
-Using FastPass in combination with other factors for step-up authentication.
-Specifying device and network conditions where FastPass can be used.
For example, you might configure your policy to:
-Allow FastPass authentication from managed devices only.
-Require additional verification for high-risk applications.
-Set different authentication requirements based on user location or network.


--------Set Up YubiKey as a FIDO2 Authenticator------------
Keep your organization safe by using a YubiKey to ensure you are
protected from security breaches such as phishing attacks
or other threat actors.

Understanding FIDO2 YubiKeys
FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online 2.0) is an open standard for user authentication that uses public key cryptography to replace passwords. Key features of the YubiKey include:
•Phishing resistant.
•Hardware protected.
•Device bound.


FIDO2 creates unique cryptographic keys for each service. 
Unlike passwords or codes that can be intercepted and reused, 
FIDO2 uses public-key cryptography where the private key never
leaves the YubiKey.

Unlike the SMS codes or authenticator apps that got compromised in
that breach, your YubiKey creates unique signatures each time you 
authenticate, and the private key never leaves the physical device
that sits on your keychain. When you tap your YubiKey, it uses
public-key cryptography to prove your identity. Your key stores a 
secret private key that signs a challenge from the website, while 
the website uses a public key to verify it's really you. This makes
it mathematically impossible for attackers to fake your identity
without physically stealing your key.

Implementing FIDO2 YubiKeys
-Add FIDO2 authenticator
  As with any authenticator, it needs to first be configured in the Admin Console.
-Add authenticator enrollment policy
  Specify the enrollment policy for the new authenticator.
-Create authentication policy
  Enforce the use of FIDO2 YubiKeys for all of your users when they authenticate
  in Okta based on the time frame you decide.
