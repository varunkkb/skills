Threat Hunting Services
    threat hunting is a proactive cyberssecurity practice i involves actively searching for signs of malicious activity within your environment
      even when there are no specific alerts or indicators meticulously ecamine data for anomalies follow trails ofeidence
      uncover hidden thrats that might have evaded your traditional security controls
    why is thrat hunting important ?
      relying solely on reactive security measures like antivirus software and firewalls is no loger sufficient
      because attackers contantly evolve tactics,techniques,procedures
      threat  hunting actively seeks out advanced persistent threats(APTs) and other malicious actors that might be lurking in network
    key benifits of threat hunting 
      proactive defence : instead of waiting for an attack to happen, threat huntung allows you take the initiative and discover threats early in their lifecycle minimizing potential damage
      imroved threat detection: actively search for signs of compramise and uncover threats that might have gone unnoticed by your automated security tools
      enhanced incident response : information gathered during threat hunting can be invaluable for understanding he scope and impact of an atack
      reduced dwell time: can minimize the time an attacker can remain undetected in environment and limit the potential damage they can inflict
    threat huntng process
          hypotesis : formulate a hypothesis about a potential threat or attack scenario
                       threat intelligence, industry trends, own observations
          data collection: relevant data from various sources  
                           security logs,network traffic , endpoint telemetry
          analysis :analyxe the collected data using tools and techniwues
                        kql quereies, statistical analysis, machine learning  
                    identify
                        patterns, anomalies, indicators of compramise
                    investigatation
                         investigate any suspicious findings to determins their legitimacy and potential impact
                    response  
                          if threat is confirmed take appopriate action to contain and remediate the issue
          who should  contuct threat hunting?
              threat hunting is best performed by skilled security analysts or threat hunters with a  deep understanding of security 
                  tools, techniwues,threat landscape

MITRE ATT&CK
   adversarial tractics, technicques and common knowledgebase of adversary tactics and techniques
   understanding attacker operations and proactive defennse against tactics
   why MITRE ATT&CK matters for threat hunting
      common language
            stanzardized vocabulary for describing adversary behaviour
            facilitates communication among security teams
      structured framework
            organizes matrix of tactics and techniques making it easier to identify and prioritze investigation
      Real-world insights
            real-world insights based on real world adversary activities,insights into attacker operations and tools
      mapping to security data
            map security data to specific tactics and techniques, enhance threat detection and investigation
  leveraging MITRE ATT&ACK in MS Sentinel
