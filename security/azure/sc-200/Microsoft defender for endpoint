3 simplified management 
   -managing endpoint security can be a complex task especially in hybrid environments
        centralized platform for managing secrity policies
        monitoring threats
        investigate incidents
        deploy solutions
   -reduce administrative overhead and improve efficiency
   - security team to focus on strategic initiatives
4 enhanced visibility
      -gain a holistic view of your org security postture
      -consolidate security data from all endpoints
      -mak informed decisions on resource allocation and prioritze security investments
      -proactively address security gaps

onboarding options
1. direct onboarding (recommended for most scenarios)
      -direct way to on board non -azure devices
      -involves installing the MDE sensor directly on the device itself
      -ideal for organizations of all sizes and requires minimal azure configuration
      -steps
          downlooad the MDE onboarding package from the security center portal.
              installer for the MDE sensor
              necessary config files
          preapre the non-azure device
              system requirments for MDE
              temporarily disabling any conflicting antivirus or endpoints protection software
          run the MDE sensor installer, provide tenant ID and token
          device register with MDE and starts reporting security data
              device listed in the devices list within the security center portal
2. Azure Aex Integration
        -for large-scale deployments or existing azure arc users.
        -leverages azure arc to manage on-premisis infra
        -streamlime onboarding experience for your non-azure devices
        - Azure Arc creates a hybrid management plane that extends azure's management capaibilities to on-premis
        -seamlessly onbiard MDE to the Microsoft defender for cloud

Microsoft defender for endpoints - Demo
Onborading non -Azure devices
        -MS defender page -> setteings -> Endpoints-> onboarding-> select OS , deployment methods -> download package

Microsoft defender for endpoint - advanced features
    -shifting from reactive to proactive 
    -deeper visibility, stronger defence
    -precision is key
    -stay ahead of evolving threats
          cutting -edge technologies like behavioral analytics and machine learning
          to combat even the most sophisticated attacks

Advanced capabilities
1. endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode
    actively blocks malicious files and behabiour in real-time
    front-line defense against zero-day attacks and emerging threats
2. Advanced hunting
     -use a powerful query languae to sift through endpoint data
        uncover hidden threats
        indicators of compromises(IOCs)
        patterns
3. Threat and vulnerbility management(TVM)
        assess the risk of each vulnerbility 
        focus on patching efforts on the most critical issues
4 Attack surface reduction rules (ASR)
      -block common attack vecors
          malicious macros
          untrusted scripts
          unauthorized network connections
      -prevetnts threats from gaining a foothold on you endpointa
5 live response
      -block common attack vectors
          investigate threats
          collect evidence
          take remediation actions in real-time
               terminating processes
                quarantining files
6 custom indicators
      -bult-in threat intelligence
           Define file hashes
           IP addresses
           URLs
           Attributes as indicators of compromise
           tailor threat detection


Advanced feature - restrict correlation
      MS defender->settings-> advanced features-> restrict correlation to within scoped device group (on/off)

Incident correlation 
    process of linking related alerts together to form a comprehensive incident
    this helps SOC analysts understand the full scope of a potential security event
    defender for endpoint correlates alerts across your entire tenant
    if multiple alerts are triggered on different devices but they share common characteristics
      tactics,techniques,procedures
      suspicious powershell activity
      lateral movement attempts
      data exfiltration attempts
    these combined indicators point to a targeted ransomware attack by a known group
    groups related alerts into a single incident

How restricting correlation works
    device group scoping
    seperate incidents
    focused investigations
    controlled visibility

EDR in block mode
  -EDR in block mode is like having a vigilant security guard at every endpoint
  -it not only detects malicioud activity but also takes immediate action  to stop it 
  -reduces the risk of damage caused by threats that traditional antivirus solutions might miss

Why enable EDR in block mode
  Zero-day protection
    block mode can block threats that have not yet been identified as malware
    offering protection against zero day attacks
  enhanced security
    provides an extra layer of security on top of antivirus solution
    strengthens your defense against sophistecated attacks
  reduced attack impack
    stops malicious activity in its tracks
    minimizes the potential damage caused by an attack
 faster incident reponse
    allows you to contain threats quickly
    buy valuable time to investigate and remediate

Who should enable EDR in block mode
  high-risk environments
    handling sensetive data or operate in high-risk industry
    the extra layer of protection provided by block mode is crucial
  limited security resources
    if small security team, block mode can help automate threat containment
  strong incident response capabilities
    block mode can complement your existing security measures
    enhance your response capabilities

considerations before enabling block mode
  false positives
    small chance of false positives where legitimate activities migh be blocked 
    monitor the results closely and adjust your settings as needed
  licensing
    EDR in block mode is typically available with MS defender for endpoint plan 2 licenses
  tesing  
     test block mode in a controlled environment before enabling it


post-enablement steps
  monitor alerts
  review blocked events to identify any false positives and adjust settings 
  fine-tune exclusions (creating exclusions)


hide potential duplicate device records
why it occurs
      multiple discovery scans  
      onboarded devices discovered
      unintentional discovert (temp or guest machines)
problem with duplicate records
    inaccurate reporting (skewed reports and metrics)
    confusing investigations
    unnecessary licencing
how to hide   
    defender for endpoint offers a simple solution in settings
