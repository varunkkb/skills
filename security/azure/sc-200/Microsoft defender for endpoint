Introduction Microsoft defender for endpoint
  -It is comprehensive endpoint protection platform (EPP)
  -layered approch of protection

Features Microsot defender for endpoint
1.Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV)
    utilizes advanced threat detection techniques
    Beyond traditional signature-based antivirus
    It utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to identify and block threats
2. Enpoint detection and response (EDR)
    povides deep visibility into endpoint activity
    continuous monitoring for suspicious behaviours 
    identifies potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts
3  attack surface reduction (ASR)
    Hardens the environment by limiting attack vectors
    restricts unathorized applications,scripts and macros
    reduces the attack surface for malicious actors
4. endpoint vulnerbility managment
   identieies and prioritzes vulners
   focus on patching critical vulnerbilties
   prevents exploitation by attackers
5  automatic remediation
   automates certain remediation actions
   isolates infected devices
   blocks malicious URLs and rolls back unautorized changes

Benifites
1. Poactive threat detection
   identifies and blocks sophisticated attacks
   including zero-day threats
   prevents significant damage
2 improved incident response
  provides deep visibility for faster incident response
  quick identification of attack scope
  facilitates appropriate mitgation actions
3. Reduced attack surface 
    hardens the environemnt 
    limits potential attack vectors
    makes it difficult for attackers to gain a foothold
4.simplified managment
   unified platform managing endpoint security
    simpliies security operations
    reduces administrative overhead

---Introduction to Azure Arc----
-The cloud computing landscape is evolving towards hybrid and multi-cloud stragegies
-managing resources across various environments is complex
-axure arc acts as a bridge, extending azure management to existing infrastructure

Azure Arc
-Azure arc manaement and governence solution for entire IT infrastructure
-unified platform : manages resourcees regardless of location 
          on-premisis resources (manage physcial and VMs (win,linux)
          other cloud environments (EC2, S3, etc)
          edge devices (IoT devices and Intelligence devices at network edge)

Core functionalities of Azure Arc
- Resource inventory and management
  obtain a comprehensice view of IT infrastructure across Axure , other cloud, on-premises
-Policy enforcement
  Apply consistent security policies and governance contols in hybrid and multi-cloud env
-configuration management  
  simplify resource configuration managment with tools like azure policy and desisired state configuration (DSC)
-data security and monitoring 
  leverage azure security services for monitring and protecting resources across diverse environments

Benifites of Azure Arc
-unified managment experience 
       manage all resources from a single pane of glass in Azure portal
       simplifies IT operations and reduce complexity
-security and governance
        apply consistent security policies across entire IT infrastructure 
        leverage azure securiy services for enhanced protection
-flexibiltir and choice
        maintain hybrid on cloud-strategy without vendor lock-in
        manage resources across Azure,other cloud, on-prem env
-innovation and optiization
        extend azure services like Azure monitor and azure automation to non azure resources
        enables enhanced monitoring ,optimization and automation capabiltites across entire IT infracture
