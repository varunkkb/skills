Advanced feature - restrict correlation
      MS defender->settings-> advanced features-> restrict correlation to within scoped device group (on/off)

Incident correlation 
    process of linking related alerts together to form a comprehensive incident
    this helps SOC analysts understand the full scope of a potential security event
    defender for endpoint correlates alerts across your entire tenant
    if multiple alerts are triggered on different devices but they share common characteristics
      tactics,techniques,procedures
      suspicious powershell activity
      lateral movement attempts
      data exfiltration attempts
    these combined indicators point to a targeted ransomware attack by a known group
    groups related alerts into a single incident

How restricting correlation works
    device group scoping
    seperate incidents
    focused investigations
    controlled visibility

EDR in block mode
  -EDR in block mode is like having a vigilant security guard at every endpoint
  -it not only detects malicioud activity but also takes immediate action  to stop it 
  -reduces the risk of damage caused by threats that traditional antivirus solutions might miss

Why enable EDR in block mode
  Zero-day protection
    block mode can block threats that have not yet been identified as malware
    offering protection against zero day attacks
  enhanced security
    provides an extra layer of security on top of antivirus solution
    strengthens your defense against sophistecated attacks
  reduced attack impack
    stops malicious activity in its tracks
    minimizes the potential damage caused by an attack
 faster incident reponse
    allows you to contain threats quickly
    buy valuable time to investigate and remediate

Who should enable EDR in block mode
  high-risk environments
    handling sensetive data or operate in high-risk industry
    the extra layer of protection provided by block mode is crucial
  limited security resources
    if small security team, block mode can help automate threat containment
  strong incident response capabilities
    block mode can complement your existing security measures
    enhance your response capabilities

considerations before enabling block mode
  false positives
    small chance of false positives where legitimate activities migh be blocked 
    monitor the results closely and adjust your settings as needed
  licensing
    EDR in block mode is typically available with MS defender for endpoint plan 2 licenses
  tesing  
     test block mode in a controlled environment before enabling it

post-enablement steps
  monitor alerts
  review blocked events to identify any false positives and adjust settings 
  fine-tune exclusions (creating exclusions)



Hide potential duplicate device records
why it occurs
      multiple discovery scans  
      onboarded devices discovered
      unintentional discovert (temp or guest machines)
problem with duplicate records
    inaccurate reporting (skewed reports and metrics)
    confusing investigations
    unnecessary licencing
how to hide   
    defender for endpoint offers a simple solution in settings
    MS defender -> settings -> endpoints -> advanced features -> "hide potential duplicate devices records (on/off)"

MS defender for endpoint :unmanaged devices
  -not actively monitored and protected by your security solutions
   personal devices(BYOD) Employee owned devices, tablets
   smarphones used for work purposes
  -IoT devices
  -Legacy systems
  -Rogue devices
Unmanaged devices pose a risk
  -unmanaged devices are like open doors for attackers
  not up-to-date security software making vulnerbile to malware and exploits
  missing security configurations leaving them exposed to misconfigurations and weakness
  visibility and monitoring makes it difficult to detect suspicious activity or attacks
Addressing unmanaged devices with MDE
  -device discovery (identify unmanaged for visibility)
  -onboarding : in MDE (install and configure agent) [onboarding by localscript,group policy,Intune])
  -MS defender for IoT for devices that cant run the full MDE agent
    MDE IoT
  -segmentation:  of unmanaged devices from critical assets to limit ptential impact, enforce security policies and restrict access using NAC
  -Monitoring and response : closely monitor for suspicious activity, use threat hunting capabilities to search for signs of compramise and repond quickly to detected threats to minimize damage
Best practices 
  -Develop a BYOD policy :clear guidlines for personal device usage in your org
  -regularly update software [including unmanaged ones have the latest security patches and updates]
  -educate users [security awareness]

Unmanaged devices - Discovery setup
MS defender portal -> settings-> device discovery-> discovery setup
Basic discovery : well suited for small homogeneous networks with mostly domain-joined devices
                  it leverages AD, discvers devices authenticated and registered with the domain
                  provides a basic inventory of domain-joined devices
                  limitations: dosent find devices outside the domain
                  not discover personal devices (BYOD), servers disconnected in workgroup, cloud-hosted resources
standard discovery: utilizes multiple methods to discover a broader range of devices
                    AD , network scanning, Azure active directory integration
                    AD leverages AD joined ,network scanning using protocols (SMB, SNMP,WMI), discovers personal devices,servers,IoT devices
                    network scanning might be limited by firewall rules or protocols restrictions
                    EntraAD integration identifies devices enrolled in entra AD , useful for org adopting cloud-bases resources and identities
                    detects potental vulnerbilities Log4j, analyzes collected device information to identify devices running vulnerable software
                    All devices option: compresnsive scanning: every compatible device running the defender for endpoint sensor becomes a scout and actively searching fr other devices on the network
                    This will have increased traffic [higher volume of network compared to other methods, potential impact on network perfomance
                    potential for false positives that you dont necessarlilt want [personal devices, IoT devices,guest machines]
                    Select tags option: create custom tags in defender for endpoints , assign to specific devices [department,locations,device type,risk level]
                    
Best practices
    regularly update tags, monitor performance [if using all devices scan option], reviwew dicovered devices [accuracy, and exclude any devices from future scans]

device discovery - exclusions
    -powerful tool to streamline your endpoint security managment
    -by intenionally omitting specific devices or IP ranges from the dicovey process
MS defender portal -> settings-> device discovery-> exclusions         
            Add device name,IP address/range, Mac address
important considerations
    regular review
    documentation
    security impact [wont be monitored by MDE, assess rike before excluding devices]

device discovery -monitoring networks
-precise control over which network segment MDE scans ,this will optimize dicovery process
