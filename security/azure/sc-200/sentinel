Bascs of kql 
-KQL is specialized dialect that allows fluent interaction with your security data
-it is a read-only language, use it to retrieve and analyze the information stored in databases or logs
-filter relevent information and transform raw data into actionable intelligence
KQl pivotal role in MS sentinel
  -proactive threat hunting
  -rapid incident investigation
  -tailored alerts
  -insightful reports and dashboards
KQL pipeline struture
    -KQL queries follow a strutured pipeline
    -data enters the pipeline from a series of transformations
    -each operation refines the data further
  Data source: logs
  Operators :filters, project,aggregate, modify
  output: table or visualization
KQL operators and functions
    filtering (where) : extract specific rows based on conditions
    projecting(project): select specific coloumns to include
    summarizing (summarize): aggregate data to find patterns and trends (sum,averages,counts,others)
    joining(join): combine data from multiple tables,to coneect different piences of information for comprehensive view
    sorting(sort): arrange results in alogical orders
    limiting(limit) : restrict the number of displayed results, preventing data overload
    scalar operators and functions
        arthmetic(+,-,*,/,%),comparison(==,!=,>,<,>=,<=),
        logical (and,or,not),
        string(has, contains,  
        startswith,endswith),
        aggregation (count(),avg(),min(),max()),
        scalar(convert data types,extract substrings,trim whitespace)),
        time(timestamps,time diffences, group events by time intervals)
Pratical examples
    SecurityEvent
    |where TimeGenereated > ago(24h) and EventID == 4624

    SecurityEvent
    |summarze EventCount =count() by EventID
    |top 10 by EventCount dec
    
Microsoft Sentinel : Key commands for filtering, joining tables
-time based filterting [TimeGenerated filed and ago() function]
wildcard and regular expressions
    broaden search criteria or find partial matches
    KQL offers wildcards(*,?) and regular expressions
    SecurityEvent
    |where AccountName matches regex @"\badmin\b"
joining tables
    combine information from different sources
    left outer join, inner join, right outer join, full outer join
    inner join: cmbines rows from both tables only when there's a match 
    left outer join: returns all the rows from the left table and matched rows from right table
    right outer join returns all the rows rom the righ table and matched rows rom the left table
    full outer join returns all the rows from both tables fills in null value if no match

Microsoft Sentinel : How KQL is specifically used in Sentinel
1. log analytics
      microsot sentinel is built upon azure monitor log analytics a powerful log management and analystics platform
      KQL is teh native query language for log analytics
2 threat detection
      KQL enables to create custom alaytics rules can trigger alerts when specific threat or anomalies detected in your data
3 threat hunting  
      KQL empowers  proactive threat hunting 
      eanbling to scraft sophisticated queries to search for indicators of compramise (IOCs) or subtle patterns of malicious behavior
4 incident investigation
      KQL allows you to quickly investigate the root cause of security incidents to race the attacker's actions and assess impact
5 reporting and visualization
      generate reports and interative dashboards
6 automation and playbooks
      kql can be integrated with Azure logic apps to create automated workflows and playbooks that automatically repond to security events in real-time
      
Real-world applications of KQL in sentinel
  -detecting brute-force attacks
  -uncover lateral movements
  -track data exfiltration
  -monitoring cloud resouce configurations

Microsoft Sentinel : Analytics Rules Overview
analytical rules are queries written in kusto query language(KQL)
continuously scan your incoming security data
-proactive threat detection
-customizability
-automation
-integration with playbooks
types of analytical rules 
    scheduled rules : run on defined schedule
    MS security rules: Pre built rules created by MS security experts

Microsoft Sentinel : Investigating incidents, entities, and timelines - Overview
incidents : an incident is a collection of related alerts and entities that together tell a story about a potential security breach
inestigating an incident  
      select an incident
      review incident details
      explore the timeline
      invesitgate entities
      analyze alerts
      add bookmarks
      collaborate
Pro tips
      start with hypothesis
      look for anomalies
      follow the breatcrumbs
      pivot on IOCs
      leverage the threat intelligence

Microsoft Sentinel 
        Investigating incidents,

Microsoft Sentinel : STIX/TAXII feeds in microsoft sentinel
    Enhanced threat detection
        ingesting threat intelligene from various sources ehnance seninel's ability to detect and alert known threats
        proactively identify and respond to potential attacks before they cause damaga
    Rich contextial information    
        STIX feeds often include detailed contexual information about threats 
                attack desc
                motivations
                recommaended mitgation strategies
        this encriched info aids in invesitgations and response efforts
    community collaboration
        STIX/TAXII is widely adopted 
        enabling access to avast network of threat intelligence providers and communities
    cutomization
        tailor threat intellgence intake by selecting specific that align with your org
        Industry,geography,threat profile
How does STIZZ/TAXII feeds work in MS sentinel
        connector acts as a bridge between sentinela and external TAXII servers that host STIX feeds
        configuration requires the TAXII server API root and collection ID
        Data inegestion :once configued senttinel peiodically polls the TAXII server
        retriesves STIX indicators and ingest them into its threat intelligence database
        correlation: setinel correlates ingested indicator with security events
        generates alerts if a match is found, enabling swift detection and response
        seninel provides several ways to leverage the ingested threat intelligence
        threat intelligence blade :central hub 
                view, manage, analyze threat intelligence feeds
        Analytical rules: can create custom analytical rules to leverage to detect specific IOC's or patterns of activity
        hunting queies   : write KQL queries to proactively search for threats based on indicators from STIX feeds

Intraducing playbooks(Logic Apps)
    Automated workflows  assist you in streamline incident response
    ensures consistent actions against security threats
Playbooks
    playbooks in MS sentinel are based on azuere logic apps
    logic apps is a cloud-based service for creating and automating worflows
    playbooks are predefined sequences of actions triggered by specific security alerts or incidents
    automate tasks that woruld otherwise require manual intervention
    notifying relevent personnel: send emails, sms messages, alerts to the security teams or stakeholders
    enriching data gather the data from threat intelligence feeds or user directories
    taking remediation actions : isolating compramised hosts,blocking malicious IP addresses, disabling compromised accounts,
    integrating with external sustems :ticketing systems,SOAR platforms, other security tools
Why playbooks matter ?
    playbooks are indispensable for modern security operations center(SOCs) because they offer several key advantages
            faster response, consistency, reduced human error,scalability, integration
Anatomy of a playbook        
        Trigger 
                the event or condition that initiates the playbook
                specific security alert or the creation of a incident
        Actions
                the sequence of tasks or steps the playbook executes when triggered
                sending an email, running a KQL query, interacting with an external API
                interacting with an external API
        Conditions(optional)
                logic statements that determine whether certain actions should be executed based on specific criteria
